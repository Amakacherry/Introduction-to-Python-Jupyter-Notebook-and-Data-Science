    "## False, None, True,As, At, Assert, Break, Class, If, Del,Elif, Else, Except\n",
    "## Return, For, From, Global, Try, Import, In, Is, Lambda, While, Not, Or, Pass, Raise\n",

    "## Python Scripts:\n",
    "## Interactive Python is good for experimentsand programs of 3-4 lines long\n",
    "## Most Programs are much longer so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file\n",
    "## In a sense we are \"giving Python a Script\".\n",
    "## As a convention, we add \".py\" as a suffix at the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Vs Script:\n",
    "## INTERACTIVE - You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds\n",
    "## SCRIPT - You enter a sequence of stmts (lines) into a file using a text editor\n",
    "## and tell Python to execute the stmt in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## PROGRAM STEPS OR PROGRAM FLOW\n",
    "## Like a recipe or installation instructions, A program is a sequence of steps to be done in order\n",
    "## Some steps are conditional - They can be skipped\n",
    "## some times a step or group of steps is to be repeated\n",
    "## Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several \n",
    "## places throughout the program (chapter 4)\n",
